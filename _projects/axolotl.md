![The Shift 6mq]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/hero_axolotl.png)


I work on core platform software and system applications & features,
in particular on ShiftOS, the _skin_ used by SHIFT Android devices.

During the development of the SHIFT 6mq, the first device powered by a
Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC by SHIFT, the Android OS was built in-house from
_scratch_, even if there exist(ed) a ShiftOS for some previous SHIFT devices.

## Interesting bits

The SHIFT 6mq is codenamed [`axolotl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl),
an animal that is notorious for its ability of regrowing limbs, a property
_shared_ by the device thanks to its modular nature that allows the components
to be replaced with a single screwdriver for easy repair. 

SHIFT-OS comes in two variations: `-G` and `-L`.

The `-G` builds are standard builds that ship with the devices and include
Google apps, while `-L` are an additional offering by SHIFT for those who'd
like to run their devices without the Google suite of apps.

The software on SHIFT devices shares some bits with
[LineageOS](https://lineageos.org), in a bidirectional way: ShiftOS uses some
components developed by the LineageOS community, and in turn SHIFT shares back
improvements, fixes and additional features to the open-source community.
Some shared bits notably include the Launcher / Trebuchet and 

Moreover, some components have been (and will be) open-sourced and made
available on GitHub on the [@SHIFTPHONES](https://github.com/SHIFTPHONES)
organization.
